# daiCy :blossom:
C library for Linux

DaiCy introduces enhanced features for the C language such as automatic array size expansion, dcstring datatype, dcmatrix datatype and much more. Each DaiCy datatype makes coding in the C language much more convinient by introducing functionality such as sorting, reversing, string manipulation etc which are features of all modern day programming languages. DaiCy aims to bridge the gap between C and the modern day programming languages.
